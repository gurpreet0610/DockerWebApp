# The one-click process to automate any application from commit to deployment using docker.
The repository aims at automating the process from commit to deployment leading to a continuous deployment procedure. This is done via error handling mechanism in build and deployment phase due to which whenever an error occurs the user will be notified via mail and the system will be restored to the previous stable state which ensures that the application will have minimum downtime.
